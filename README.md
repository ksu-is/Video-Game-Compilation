# Video-Game-Compilation
The idea I have in mind if to create a compilation of my favorite video games as a kid. This would include snake and minesweeper. The application itself will give the user the choice to choose which game they would like to play. Once the user wins or loses a match, they will get the option to start over, play the other game or simply exit the application. This application could use 2 people as I believe it is going to be a challenging task to join games under one application and designing them.
